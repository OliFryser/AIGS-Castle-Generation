# AIGS-Castle-Generation

## Installation

We use conda for managing the python environment. We have provided the configuration file ``environment.yml`` for easy installation. We have dubbed our environment "fortify".

1. Open a conda shell
2. Run ``conda env create -f configuration.yml`` or ``conda env update -f configuration.yml``, if you have already created the environment.
3. Run ``conda activate fortify``.
